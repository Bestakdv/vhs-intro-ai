Project Overview: The purpose of these projects were to learn about graphs and get an introduction into Data Science.

Technologies Used: These projects were all done in python and some libraries that were used are NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn,  

How to Run: In order to run these projects you need to run them on Google Colab.

Challenges Faced: Some challenges that were faced was the initial learning of the different libraries as it was my first time using them and creating the algorithm for Astar.

Future Improvements: To improve these learning projects I could have gone more in depth to learn more about Data Science.
