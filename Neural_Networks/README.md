Project Overview: The purpose of these projects were to learn about neural networks. In these projects I learned about architecture, training process and how to evaluate a model.

Technologies Used: These projects were all done in python and were used to learn about different kinds of models such as CNN, . The library that was used the most for these projects was Keras.

How to Run: In order to run these projects you need to run them on Kaggle and Google Colab.

Challenges Faced: Some challenges that were faced was the initial learning of the CNN models.

Future Improvements: To improve these learning projects I could have done more complex models in order to better understand neural networks.
