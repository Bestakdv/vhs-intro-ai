Project Overview: The purpose of these projects were to learn about neural networks. In these projects I learned about architecture, training process and how to evaluate a model.

Technologies Used: These projects were all done in python and were used to learn about different kinds of models such as CNN. The libraries that were used the most for project were Keras, Matplotlib, and Pandas

How to Run: In order to run these projects you need to run them on Kaggle and Google Colab.

Challenges Faced: Some challenges that were faced was the initial learning of the CNN models as they are complex.

Future Improvements: To improve these learning projects I could have done more complex models in order to better understand neural networks.
