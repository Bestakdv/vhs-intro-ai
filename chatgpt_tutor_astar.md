# ChatGPT as a tutor


**can you please write the A Star algorithm in python and explain it using haversine**


>code is in notebook
and explanation is The A* algorithm calculates the f(n) value for each node, which is the sum of g(n) and h(n):
f(n)=g(n)+h(n)
The node with the smallest f(n) value is selected to explore next. The algorithm continues until it finds the goal node.
>g(n) is the cost from the start node to n and h(n) is the heuristic estimate of the cost from node n to the goal node

**why is my answer always wrong when using haversine is it because my radians are wrong?
        earthRadius = 6371
        latitude1, longitude1 = coord1
        latitude2, longitude2 = coord2
        radLat1, radLat2 = math.radians(latitude1), math.radians(longitude2)
        deltaLat = math.radians(latitude2 - latitude1)
        deltaLon = math.radians(longitude2 - longitude1)
        #using the haversine math formulas
        a = math.sin(deltaLat / 2) ** 2 + math.cos(radLat1) * math.cos(radLat2) * math.sin(deltaLon / 2) ** 2
        c = 2 * math.atan2(math.sqrt(a), math.sqrt(1 - a))
        #in kilometers
        return earthRadius * c**

>You assigned radLat2 using longitude2 instead of latitude2.
Latitude and Longitude Ranges:
Make sure the coordinates you're passing in (i.e., coord1 and coord2) are indeed in degrees, as the conversion to radians is necessary for the trigonometric functions to work correctly


**why do you need to use radians for haversine and not degrees**

>Most programming languages, including Python, define trigonometric functions such as sin(), cos(), and tan() to take input in radians. For instance, in Pythonâ€™s math module, functions like math.sin() and math.cos() expect the input angle to be in radians.
