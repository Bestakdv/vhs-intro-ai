# ChatGPT as a tutor


**can you please write the A Star algorithm in python and explain it using haversine**


>code is in notebook
and explanation is The A* algorithm calculates the f(n) value for each node, which is the sum of g(n) and h(n):
f(n)=g(n)+h(n)
The node with the smallest f(n) value is selected to explore next. The algorithm continues until it finds the goal node.
>g(n) is the cost from the start node to n and h(n) is the heuristic estimate of the cost from node n to the goal node

**why do you need to use radians for haversine and not degrees**

>Most programming languages, including Python, define trigonometric functions such as sin(), cos(), and tan() to take input in radians. For instance, in Pythonâ€™s math module, functions like math.sin() and math.cos() expect the input angle to be in radians.
